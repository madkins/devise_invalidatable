# devise_invalidatable

Adds support for [Devise](http://github.com/plataformatec/devise) to manually invalidate sessions on the server-side.

The core logic was shamelessly copied from [this](http://www.jonathanleighton.com/articles/2013/revocable-sessions-with-devise/) blog post by [@jonleighton](https://github.com/jonleighton). I just packaged it into a Devise extension for easy use.

## Installation

Add `devise_invalidatable` to your Gemfile and install
```
gem 'devise_invalidatable`
```
```
bundle install
```
Run the generator with the name of your Devise resource (e.g. User)
```
rails g devise_invalidatable User
```
This will add the directive to the resource's model and create a migration for the sessions table.

If using Mongoid, run the generator with `--mongoid`
```
rails g devise_invalidatable User --mongoid
```
This will add the directive to the resource's model and create a user session model.
